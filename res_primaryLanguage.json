    "description": "My name is Faruk Mert Yüksel, born on June 5, 1998, in Istanbul, Turkey. After completing my education in Exercise and Sports Sciences in Istanbul, I moved to the United States. My journey in sports began in childhood with kickboxing, where I developed a passionate career. Over the years, I achieved success in various national and international championships and had the honor of representing the Turkish National Kickboxing Team.\n\nIn 2016, I decided to pursue a career in coaching (Personal Training) and have since focused on continuous improvement in this field. After relocating to Houston, Texas, I opened a gym, where I continue my kickboxing training while also coaching. My approach to coaching goes beyond teaching technical skills; I strive to instill important values such as mental resilience and discipline in my students. I believe that sports should be a way of life, and I aim to inspire and support each athlete in reaching their personal goals.\n\nIn addition to my coaching career, I am also involved in e-commerce, exploring new opportunities in the digital world and enhancing my knowledge in this area. The possibilities offered by online commerce feed my entrepreneurial spirit and allow me to apply my experiences in the sports industry to the business world. I actively participate in international camps to share experiences with athletes from diverse cultures and to continue developing my skills.",
